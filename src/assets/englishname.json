{"name":"blanche","origin":"French","meaning":"white","gender":"F","description":"Blanche originates in Germanic languages and means \"the white one\". Some sources suggest the name might have become popular due to its connotation of a skin white as milk, which was considered a mark of female beauty in medieval times. Possibly due to that, Blanche was a popular name within royalty for many centuries. ","info":"Blanche, which originated as a nickname for a pale blonde and then became associated with the notion of purity, was in style a century ago, ranking in the double digits until 1920. She then had to fight the stereotype of faded Southern belle, a la Blanche DuBois in Tennessee Williams's A Streetcar Named Desire and Blanche Devereaux in TV's Golden Girls. Now all three of the Golden Girls--Blanche, Rose and Dorothy--could be ready for revival, with Blanche sounding like a stronger, simpler alternative to Bianca.\nA saint's name, Blanche was a royal name in France by the twelfth century, then was brought to England by the French wife of Henry I.

Saint Agnes is the patron saint of chastity, engaged couples and virgins.","info":"Agnes, though it was the third most common English girls' name for four hundred years, has long been stuck in the attic. But now it looks like Agnes was so far out it's just about ready to come back in. It did look cute on a little girl in Despicable Me, and nickname Aggie has lots of retro appeal. \nAgnes has also been making inroads in the celebrisphere—first actress Elisabeth Shue chose Agnes for her third child, and more recently Jennifer Connelly and Paul Bettany named their daughter Agnes Lark.  \nIn medieval times, St. Agnes was a very popular saint, leading to its popularity as a girl's name.

Donald was a Top 20 name throughout most of the early twentieth century.  But first there was the quacking Donald Duck, introduced in 1934, to affect its image, and then there was The Donald Trump, leaving it drained of much baby appeal. Trump's surprising run to the presidency didn't save Donald's decline on the baby name charts; it fell 47 spots between 2015 and 2016, from 441 to 488, and is now a less popular name than it's been since records have been kept.\n Aside from Donald Sutherland, most contemporary real and fictive Donalds go by nicknames--as in Donny Osmond, Donnie Wahlberg, Don Rickles and Don Draper. More promising and more authentically Celtic sounding is Donal, which is quite commonly used in Ireland, or surname cousins Donnelly or Donovan. "},
